# Heath-Basic
This is the recomened modpack for the Heath family server. You can still use Vanilla if you would like but we would recomend you use this modpack. This modpack is esentialy Optifine on steroids with a few extra optimization mods.  I may make a fork of this modpack so it can run on a Rasberry Pi.
